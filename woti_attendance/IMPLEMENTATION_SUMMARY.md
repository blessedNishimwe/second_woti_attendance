### 🗂️ Files Created/Modified

#### New Files:
- `lib/attendance_screen.dart` - Main attendance screen with all functionality
- `database_schema.sql` - Complete database schema for attendance table
- `ATTENDANCE_SETUP.md` - Setup documentation

#### Modified Files:
- `pubspec.yaml` - Added required dependencies
- `lib/main.dart` - Integrated new attendance screen
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Added Android permissions
- `ios/Runner/Info.plist` - Added iOS permissions
- `test/widget_test.dart` - Updated tests for new app structure

### 📱 Dependencies Added

- `geolocator: ^10.1.0` - GPS location services
- `permission_handler: ^11.2.0` - Device permissions management
- `camera: ^0.10.5+9` - Camera access for photos
- `image_picker: ^1.0.7` - Photo capture and selection
- `intl: ^0.19.0` - Date/time formatting

### 🗄️ Database Schema

Created complete Supabase schema with:
- `attendance` table with all required fields
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Storage bucket for attendance photos
- Proper indexes for performance
- Auto-updating timestamps

### 🎨 UI/UX Features

- **Dark theme** consistent with existing app design
- **Real-time updates** for time and location
- **Visual status indicators** (green for checked in, orange for checked out)
- **Distance validation feedback** with icons and colors
- **Loading states** for all async operations
- **Pull-to-refresh** functionality
- **Responsive design** for various screen sizes

### 🔒 Security & Permissions

- **Android permissions**: Location (fine/coarse), Camera, Storage, Internet
- **iOS permissions**: Location when in use, Camera, Photo library
- **Supabase RLS**: Users can only access their own attendance records
- **Photo storage**: Secure upload to Supabase storage with proper policies

### 🛡️ Error Handling

- **Location permission denied** - Clear error messages with guidance
- **Network connectivity issues** - Offline handling and retry logic
- **Camera permission denied** - Graceful degradation without photos
- **Missing facility coordinates** - Warning messages but allows operation
- **Invalid distance** - Clear validation with distance display
- **Database errors** - User-friendly error messages

### ⚡ Performance Optimizations

- **Efficient location updates** - Only when needed
- **Image optimization** - Compressed photos for storage
- **Database indexing** - Optimized queries
- **State management** - Minimal rebuilds with proper setState usage

### 🧪 Testing

- Updated widget tests to match new app structure
- Added basic navigation and UI presence tests
- Tests verify login screen and navigation to register screen

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Database Setup**: Run the `database_schema.sql` file in your Supabase SQL editor
2. **Facility Coordinates**: Add latitude/longitude to your facilities table
3. **Storage Bucket**: Verify the `attendance_photos` bucket is created in Supabase Storage
4. **Testing**: Build and test the app on a physical device or emulator
5. **Configuration**: Adjust the `FACILITY_RADIUS_METERS` constant if needed (currently 100m)
